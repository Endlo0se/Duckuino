# Duckuino for ESPloit  
  
Dckuino.js was originally written by Plazmaz and Nurrl to convert Ducky Script payloads into Arduino sketches which in turn would be uploaded and ran on an Arduino board.  
  
The version in this repository has been modified by Corey Harding to convert Ducky Script payloads for devices which are running the ESPloit software, such as the Cactus WHID.  
  
Simply copy/paste or write your Ducky Script into the text area on the left, click Compile, and then copy/paste or download the output from the text area on the right to be used with ESPloit.  

A live version is available at: https://exploitagency.github.io/Duckuino/
